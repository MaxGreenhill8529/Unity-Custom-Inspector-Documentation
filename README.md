# Unity-Custom-Inspector-Documentation
This documentation is unofficial and was made for my own personal reference.\
This is for the original and thus older version of Unity's custom inspector solution ['IMGUI'](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.1/Documentation/Manual/GUIScriptingGuide.html) and while it is still supported and a way to implement custom inspectors, the company is leaning towards using their newer UI Toolkit. 
> Unity intends for UI Toolkit to become the recommended UI system for new UI development projects, but it still lacks some features available in uGUI and IMGUI.
